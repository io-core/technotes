# Tech Note 011 - Scripting in Integrated Oberon
### Automating command application with scripts

It is convenient to automate the application of commands.

* lines of "Module.Command argument" should be supported for scripting familiar operations
* Conditionals, variable substituion, etc. are desireable
* Pipes would be nice
* prompt interaction is useful
* environment variables add customizability

In A2 Oberon the Oberon.Configuration module provides an example of batch execution of Oberon commands
