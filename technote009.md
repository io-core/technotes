# Tech Note 009 - 64-bit Oberon0
### Adapting the Oberon07 compiler and Oberon OS to 64-bits

* Much has been done before: https://www.modulaware.com/mdlt68.htm https://github.com/vishaps/voc
* Same compiler source should compile on 64 and 32 bit systems
* 64 and 32 bit compilers should compile 64 and 32 bit code equivalently
* LONGINT should accept a system pointer, therefore follows system register size
